<h2>Events</h2>
<p>The Event Post Type plugin creates a new post type in Wordpress to handle events - posts which have a start and end date - and display them in an order dictated by these dates. It is essentially a Wordpress Post which has its own taxonomies (categories and tags), and is ordered in a different way.</p>
<p>In addition, the plugin can output calendars and feeds in different formats (RSS, JSON, iCAL), and creates its own permalink structure to enable the display of events using dates in the URL.</p>
<h3>Creating a new event</h3>
<p>This is done in the same way as you would create a new post, with the addition of setting dates for the event.</p>
<p>On the post edit screen, you will see a box on the right (or below the editor, depending on your screen display preferences) with some inputs for a start date/time and an end date/time. Clicking in these inputs will display a date/time picker to help you input dates in the correct format.</p>
<p>Once you have added a start date/time, you can check a box to indicate that the event takes place for the whole day (checking this will hide the date controls for duration and finish), or select a duration from a drop-down list to automatically input the end date/time. You can also input the end date/time for the event manually using the same method as you used for the start date/time.</p>
<p>You can also mark the event as "sticky" - this will put the event at the top of the events listing on the events archive page (if you have set the display of sticky events in the plugin options). This enables you to promote events which may be taking place far into the future, and may only make it onto the events archive page shortly before they take place - depenmding on the frequency of the events you are promoting.</p>
<p>The remaining field is for a URL of an external site where the details of the event are published. If this is filled in, links to the event from the events archive page, or from listings generated by the widget or shortcode, will point to the external URL.</p>
<p>For some output formats, the content or excerpt for the post is dispolayed in the listings, so ensure you have filled out these fields if you are using these output formats.</p>
<h3>Events formatting</h3>
<p>The options in the plugin to control the formatting of events should suit the majority of user needs. If you want to change the HTML output for events and have mnore control over their display, you can do this in a number of different ways:</p>
<h4>Customising templates</h4>
<p>The plugin utilises two different templates for display of an archive page and a single event, called <code>archive-event.php</code> and <code>single-event.php</code> respectively. If you copy these templates from the plugin directory to your theme directory, the plugin will use the templates in your theme instead, allowing you to change the formatting to whatever suits your needs.</p>
<h4>Using filters</h4>
<p>Some of the output from the plugin is handled internally, so can only be changed by using filters. The following filters are available:</p>
<dl>
	<dt><code>event-format</code></dt>
	<dd><p>This filter is used to format the output of a single event in a listing generated by the shortcode or widget. A filter function will be passed a post object as its only argument, and its output is expected to be returned (not printed) as formatted as HTML. The post object also contains the event meta fields  in a <code>meta</code> property, with the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>$post->meta["event_start"]</code> - the start date of the event, expressed as a UNIX timestamp.</li>
			<li><code>$post->meta["event_end"]</code> - the end date of the event, expressed as a UNIX timestamp.</li>
			<li><code>$post->meta["event_allday"]</code> - a boolean (true/false) value indicating whether it is an all day event.</li>
			<li><code>$post->meta["event_is_sticky"]</code> -a boolean (true/false) value indicating whether it is a sticky event.</li>
			<li><code>$post->meta["event_url"]</code> - the URL for the event.</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt><code>event-date-format</code></dt>
	<dd><p>This filter is used to format dates. The filter function will be passed and array containing the following members:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>start</code> - the start date of the event, expressed as a UNIX timestamp.</li>
			<li><code>end</code> - the end date of the event, expressed as a UNIX timestamp.</li>
			<li><code>allday</code> - a boolean (true/false) value indicating whether it is an all day event.</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt><code>event-search-bar</code></dt>
	<dd>This filter can be used to change the appearance of the search bar. The filter function will be passed the finished output from the plugin.</dd>
