<h2>Plugin Options</h2>
<p>Options for the plugin are split into three sections, one which contains the settings for the plugin which govern the way it integrates with the site, one to set the display options for event archive pages, and one to set the format of dates shown by the plugin.</p>
<p>THe main plugin options include some very important settings which govern the URL structure used by the plugin - what slug will be used in the site's URL for the post type, and what keywords are used for event categories and tags. There is also a setting for the slug used to display pages of future events, which are handled outside the regular Wordpress paging mechanism.</p>
<p>There is also an option here to exclude the javascript and css used for the display of the events calendar and events list. This is provided so you can include the script and CSS in your theme if you wish - note however that the script is dependent on the JQuery library to work.</p>
<h3>Event Archive Options</h3>
<p>These options control the display of event archive pages. The archive page will, by default, list upcoming events in date order, with the next event at the top of the list and other future events in chronological order underneath. The order of events is reversed for past events, with the most recent displayed first and older events displayed in reverse chronological order after it (like regular blog posts).</p>
<p>The event archive pages do not exist in the sense of regular pages and posts in the Wordpress system, so there are two settings here where you can set the title of the archive page, and include some content above the events listing.</p>
<p>All archive pages can include a search bar with a search input (allowing a search within Events), and tools to filter events by category or tag. They can also include a calendar (note that the calendar will always display the current month, no matter what archive page it is displayed on).</p>
<p>The other options for archives govern the number of events which are displayed on the main archive page and other archive pages (past and future). The main archive page can also include a set number of "sticky" events which can be set here.</p>
<h3>Event Date Options</h3>
<p>The options for date display include settings for date and time formats, date and time labels, and separators between them. The options form will show a preview of the date and time formatted according to your settings.</p>
