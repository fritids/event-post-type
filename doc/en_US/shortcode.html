<h2>Shortcode</h2>
<p><strong>Shortcodes</strong> in Wordpress are used to simplify adding complex markup to pages to embed things like video, audio, scripts and image galleries. To use the events shortcode, you type the events keyword in square brackets in the content of your post/page wherever you want the events listing or calendar to appear. The shortcode can also hold additional information, or options, in a series of name/value pairs, e.g.</p>
<p><code>[events option1=&quot;value1&quot; option2=&quot;value2&quot;]</code></p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<h4>format</h4>
<p><em>optional (default &ldquo;title&quot;)</em> Can be one of the following:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>calendar</dt>
	<dd>This will display a calendar on the page. You can also set a filter when you select this option to show posts only from certain categories, tagged with certain tags, or taking place between certain dates.</dd>
	<dt>title</dt>
	<dd>Each event is listed in an unordered HTML list by the title, linked to the URL for the corresponding event. The date appears under the title (using a line break).</dd>
	<dt>title_excerpt</dt>
	<dd>Each event is listed in an unordered HTML list by the title, linked to the page for the corresponding event. The date appears in a paragraph under the title, and the excerpt for the event is included under the date.</dd>
	<dt>title_excerpt_thumbnail</dt>
	<dd>Each event is listed in an unordered HTML list using the title and post thumbnail (featured image) which are linked to the URL for the event. This is followed by the date and the excerpt.</dd>
	<dt>title_content</dt>
	<dd>Each event is listed in an unordered HTML list by the title, linked to the page for the corresponding event. The date appears in a paragraph under the title, and the full content for the event is included under the date.</dd>
	<dt>title_excerpt_thumbnail</dt>
	<dd>Each event is listed in an unordered HTML list using the title and post thumbnail (featured image) which are linked to the URL for the event. This is followed by the date and the full content.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>preset</h4>
<p>Use this option to display events according to one of the following presets:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>calendar</dt>
	<dd>This performs the same function as the <strong>calendar</strong> format option above.</dd>
	<dt>list_with_calendar</dt>
	<dd>This outputs a list of events with a calendar.</dd>
	<dt>list</dt>
	<dd>This outputs events as a list (the default behaviour).</dd>
</dl>
<h4>category_filter</h4>
<p>This will filter the events to be displayed by event category. Use event category "slugs" here separated by commas.</p>
<h4>tag_filter</h4>
<p>This will filter the events to be displayed by event tag. Use event tag "slugs" here separated by commas.</p>
<h4>start</h4>
<p>Use this to specify a start date/time for events. Only those events whose end date/time occur after this date will be included (use dates in the format <code>dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss</code>).</p>
<h4>end</h4>
<p>Use this to specify an end date/time for events. Only those events whose start date/time occur before this date will be included (use dates in the format <code>dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss</code>).</p>
<h4>thumbnail_size</h4>
<p>This controls the size of the thumbnail used in a list of events when the format setting includes it. It can be set to a standard Wordpress thumbnail size, a custom image size defined by <code>add_image_size()</code> in the theme, or a custom size (like <code>200x100</code> for example).</p>
<h4>prioritise_sticky</h4>
<p>This setting controls whether "sticky" events are prioritised (i.e. moved to the top) of an events list generated by the shortcode.</p>
<h4>num</h4>
<p>This setting will limit the number of events shown in the list.</p>
<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>The EventPostType plugin comes with a widget which you can use in your sidebars to display a calendar, list events, or both. Each widget allows you to set different options.</p>
<h3>Widget options</h3>
<p>Widget options are the same as the options which can be used in the shortcode - see above fo an explanation of what these options accomplish.</p>
